# How to update your info or image
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo
3. To change your name
   1. Name your image the same as the current existing one.  Names should be all lower case, all words together no spaces, dashes, underscores.
4. To change your link info
   1. Only modify the value of the key.
   2. Don't add more keys.  If others become supported, I will officially modify the json file.

I should be fairly quick to approve PR requests.  Tag me on twitter if you're impatient. :)
Love you all
Lets rock this!
